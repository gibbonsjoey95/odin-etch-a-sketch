# Etch-A-Sketch Project

## Description
This project involves creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It's an opportunity to flex your DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation skills. The goal is to build an interactive tool that allows users to draw and sketch within a designated area on the web page.

## Features
- **Drawing Canvas:** Provide a canvas or designated area where users can draw and sketch.
- **User Interaction:** Implement functionality for users to draw using their mouse or other input devices.
- **Color Options:** Allow users to choose different colors for their drawings.
- **Reset/Restart:** Include an option to clear or reset the drawing canvas.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: For styling and layout design.
- JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and implementing interactive features.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Use the drawing tools to sketch within the designated canvas.
3. Choose different colors to enhance your drawings.
4. Use the reset option to clear the canvas and start a new sketch.

## Project Structure
The code is organized into the following main files:

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure of the project.
- **styles.css:** Provides styling for the layout and visual elements.
- **script.js:** Implements the JavaScript logic for DOM manipulation and interactivity.

## Future Enhancements
- **Resizable Canvas:** Allow users to adjust the size of the drawing canvas.
- **Save/Export Drawings:** Implement functionality to save or export the created drawings.

## Live Demo
